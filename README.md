# Lunar Tear

Private server research project for a certain discontinued mobile game.
Discord server: <https://discord.gg/MZAf5aVkJG>

## How To Launch The Server

### Download & Run (no setup)

Prebuilt binaries are published for Linux, macOS, and Windows on the [Releases page](https://github.com/Walter-Sparrow/lunar-tear/releases).

1. Download the archive for your OS/arch (`lunar-tear-server-<version>-<os>-<arch>.{tar.gz,zip}`).
2. Run `./wizard` (macOS/Linux) or double-click `wizard.exe` (Windows).

### Prerequisites (build from source)

- Go 1.25+
- [goose](https://github.com/pressly/goose) migration tool
- Populated `server/assets/` directory

```bash
go install github.com/pressly/goose/v3/cmd/goose@latest
```

### Quick Start (Wizard)

The interactive wizard walks you through setup with a few simple questions — no flags or networking knowledge needed. It auto-detects the right IP address for your emulator or phone and launches all services.

```bash
cd server
go run ./cmd/wizard
```

Your choices are saved so next time you just press Enter to relaunch with the same settings. To skip the confirmation prompt entirely (useful for scripts or quick relaunches), pass `--prefer-saved`:

```bash
go run ./cmd/wizard --prefer-saved
```

If no saved config exists, the flag prints an error and exits.

#### Custom Ports

By default the wizard uses ports 8003 (gRPC), 8080 (CDN), and 3000 (auth). Override any of them with flags:

```bash
go run ./cmd/wizard --grpc-port 9003 --cdn-port 9080
```

| Flag             | Default | Description                                                                                                              |
| ---------------- | ------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `--prefer-saved` | `false` | Reuse saved config without prompting                                                                                     |
| `--grpc-port`    | `8003`  | gRPC server port                                                                                                         |
| `--cdn-port`     | `8080`  | CDN server port                                                                                                          |
| `--auth-port`    | `3000`  | Auth server port                                                                                                         |
| `--admin-port`   | `0`     | Admin webhook port (`0` = disabled). Bound on `127.0.0.1`; only takes effect when `LUNAR_ADMIN_TOKEN` is set in the env. |
| `--user`         | _(empty)_ | In-game player name to pin every login to ([Single-Account Mode](#single-account-mode)). Saved to `.wizard.json`; pass `--user ""` to clear. |

Custom ports are saved to `.wizard.json` alongside your other settings. On the next run the saved ports are reused automatically — no need to pass the flags again. If you later pass different port flags, the wizard warns you that the ports changed and asks for confirmation before continuing.

### Regenerate protobuf stubs

```bash
cd server
make proto
```

### Database

Player state is stored in a SQLite database. Run migrations before starting the server:

```bash
cd server
make migrate
```

Or manually:

```bash
cd server
mkdir -p db
goose -dir migrations -allow-missing sqlite3 db/game.db up
```

### Backups & Restore

The wizard backs up your save every time you launch it. To roll back to an earlier save:

```bash
cd server
make restore
```

Pick a backup from the list and confirm.

### Importing a Snapshot

To import a JSON snapshot into the database, use the import tool. The `--uuid` flag must match the UUID your game client sends during authentication:

```bash
cd server
make import SNAPSHOT=snapshots/scene_1.json UUID=<your-client-uuid>
```

Or directly:

```bash
go run ./cmd/import-snapshot \
  --snapshot snapshots/scene_1.json \
  --uuid <your-client-uuid> \
  --db db/game.db
```

| Flag         | Default      | Description                                   |
| ------------ | ------------ | --------------------------------------------- |
| `--snapshot` | _(required)_ | Path to JSON snapshot file                    |
| `--uuid`     | _(required)_ | UUID to assign (must match the client's UUID) |
| `--db`       | `db/game.db` | SQLite database path                          |

### Run

The server is split into two binaries: a gRPC game server and an HTTP asset CDN. Both must be running for the client to work.

**Start the CDN** (serves asset bundles, list.bin, master data, web pages):

```bash
cd server
go run ./cmd/octo-cdn \
  --listen 0.0.0.0:8080 \
  --public-addr 10.0.2.2:8080
```

**Start the game server** (gRPC, points the client at the CDN):

```bash
cd server
go run ./cmd/lunar-tear \
  --listen 0.0.0.0:8003 \
  --public-addr 10.0.2.2:8003 \
  --octo-url http://10.0.2.2:8080
```

The default listen address is `0.0.0.0:443`, which requires `sudo` (privileged port). Use `--listen` with a high port to avoid this. If you do need port 443, either use `sudo` or grant the binary the capability on Linux:

```bash
go build -o lunar-tear ./cmd/lunar-tear
sudo setcap cap_net_bind_service=+ep ./lunar-tear
./lunar-tear --public-addr 10.0.2.2:443 --octo-url http://10.0.2.2:8080
```

The CDN can run on a completely separate machine — just set `--octo-url` on the game server and `--public-addr` on the CDN to the externally-reachable address.

### Run All Services At Once

Instead of starting each service individually, use the dev runner to launch all three (auth, CDN, game server) with a single command. No Docker required — works on macOS, Linux, and Windows.

```bash
cd server
make dev
```

Or directly:

```bash
cd server
go run ./cmd/dev
```

Each service's output is prefixed with a colored label (`[auth]`, `[cdn]`, `[grpc]`). Press Ctrl+C to shut everything down.

The dev runner automatically builds each service into `bin/` before launching. This means the binaries have stable file paths, so **Windows Firewall only prompts once** — subsequent runs reuse the same allowed executables. The wizard performs the same build step transparently.

Override defaults with namespaced flags:

```bash
go run ./cmd/dev --grpc.listen 0.0.0.0:9000 --grpc.public-addr 10.0.2.2:9000 --cdn.public-addr 192.168.1.50:8080
```

Or via `make`:

```bash
make dev ARGS="--grpc.listen 0.0.0.0:9000 --grpc.public-addr 10.0.2.2:9000"
```

### Game Server Flags (`lunar-tear`)

| Flag             | Default          | Description                                                                 |
| ---------------- | ---------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `--listen`       | `0.0.0.0:443`    | gRPC listen address (host:port)                                             |
| `--public-addr`  | `127.0.0.1:443`  | externally-reachable host:port advertised to clients                        |
| `--octo-url`     | _(required)_     | CDN base URL the client uses for assets (e.g. `http://10.0.2.2:8080`)       |
| `--db`           | `db/game.db`     | SQLite database path                                                        |
| `--auth-url`     | _(empty)_        | Auth server base URL (e.g. `http://localhost:3000`)                         |
| `--admin-listen` | `127.0.0.1:8082` | Admin webhook listen address. Only binds when `LUNAR_ADMIN_TOKEN` is set.   |
| `--no-register`  | `false`          | Disable new user registrations (only already registered users can connect). |
| `--user`         | _(empty)_        | In-game player name to pin every client session to (see below). Falls back to `LUNAR_USER`. |

### Single-Account Mode

Normally each client is identified by a UUID it generates itself, and the server maps that UUID to its own account. Reinstall the client, switch emulators, or connect a second device and you land on a different save.

Passing `--user` with an in-game player name pins the server to that one account:

```bash
go run ./cmd/lunar-tear \
  --listen 0.0.0.0:8003 \
  --public-addr 10.0.2.2:8003 \
  --octo-url http://10.0.2.2:8080 \
  --user "PlayerName"
```

Every client that connects resolves to that account, regardless of the UUID it sends, how many accounts exist in the database, or how many old sessions are stored. Specifically:

- login by UUID, by session key (including unknown, stale, and expired keys), and by linked Facebook id all return the pinned account;
- a fresh client's registration call returns the pinned account **without creating a new one**, so repeated reinstalls no longer litter the database with throwaway saves;
- no auth server is required — the name is looked up in the game database's own `user_profile` table.

The name must match exactly (it is case-sensitive). If it doesn't, the server refuses to start and prints the accounts it does know about:

```
--user "Alcie": no account with that in-game name.
Known accounts:
  user_id=1  Alice
  user_id=2  Bob
```

So the account has to exist first: start the server once without `--user`, create and name the character in-game, then restart with `--user "<that name>"`. The same flag is available on the wizard and the dev runner, which pass it straight through.

For deployments configured purely through the environment, `LUNAR_USER` does the same thing:

```bash
LUNAR_USER="PlayerName" docker compose up -d
```

The compose file forwards `LUNAR_USER` to the game server (set it in your shell or in `.env`), and the server reads it directly — there is no entrypoint flag to pass. An explicit `--user` wins over `LUNAR_USER`; leaving both unset restores normal per-UUID behavior. Startup errors name whichever one you set:

```
LUNAR_USER="Alcie": no account with that in-game name.
```

Under Compose that failure is fatal on every start, and `restart: unless-stopped` will keep retrying — `docker compose logs server` shows the message and the known accounts.

This is a read/route-time override, not a migration — nothing in the database is renamed, merged, or deleted. Dropping the flag restores normal per-UUID behavior, and the other accounts are still there. `claim-account` remains the tool for actually merging a throwaway account into an existing one.

### Live Master Data Reload

The game server reads its master data from `assets/release/20240404193219.bin.e` at startup. To swap in updated content **without restarting** the server:

1. Replace `assets/release/20240404193219.bin.e` on disk with your edited copy.
2. POST to the admin webhook with a Bearer token matching `LUNAR_ADMIN_TOKEN`:

```bash
curl -X POST -H "Authorization: Bearer ${LUNAR_ADMIN_TOKEN}" \
  http://127.0.0.1:8082/api/admin/master-data/reload
```

The server re-reads the file, atomically swaps every in-memory catalog and derived handler, and bumps the file's mtime. The mtime is folded into `GetLatestMasterDataVersion`, so connected clients see a new version string and re-download the file from the CDN on their next poll.

Security defaults are fail-closed:

- `LUNAR_ADMIN_TOKEN` **must** be set in the environment, or the webhook listener never binds.
- `--admin-listen` defaults to `127.0.0.1:8082` (loopback only). Bind to `0.0.0.0` only if you intend to expose it.
- Authentication uses constant-time Bearer-token comparison.

### CDN Flags (`octo-cdn`)

| Flag            | Default          | Description                                               |
| --------------- | ---------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| `--listen`      | `0.0.0.0:8080`   | local bind address                                        |
| `--public-addr` | `127.0.0.1:8080` | externally-reachable address (used in list.bin rewriting) |
| `--assets-dir`  | `.`              | root directory containing the `assets/` tree              |

### Docker

Three services are available via Docker Compose: the game server (`lunar-tear`), the CDN (`octo-cdn`), and the auth server (`auth-server`). Migrations run automatically on game server start.

```bash
cd server
docker compose up -d
```

The `db/` directory is mounted as a volume so both `game.db` and `auth.db` persist across restarts. Make sure `assets/` is populated before starting.

Each service has its own image and can be deployed independently:

| Service  | Image                       | Default Port | Notes                            |
| -------- | --------------------------- | ------------ | -------------------------------- |
| `server` | `kretts/lunar-tear:latest`  | 8003, 8082   | gRPC game server + admin webhook |
| `cdn`    | `kretts/octo-cdn:latest`    | 8080         | HTTP asset CDN                   |
| `auth`   | `kretts/auth-server:latest` | 3000         | Account registration and login   |

The game server is configured via environment variables in the compose file:

| Env var              | Description                                                                           |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `LUNAR_LISTEN`       | gRPC bind address                                                                     |
| `LUNAR_PUBLIC_ADDR`  | Client-facing address advertised to the game                                          |
| `LUNAR_OCTO_URL`     | CDN base URL the client uses for assets                                               |
| `LUNAR_AUTH_URL`     | Auth server base URL (optional)                                                       |
| `LUNAR_ADMIN_LISTEN` | Admin webhook bind address inside the container (compose default: `0.0.0.0:8082`)     |
| `LUNAR_ADMIN_TOKEN`  | Bearer token for the admin webhook. **The webhook does not bind unless this is set.** |
| `LUNAR_USER`         | In-game player name to pin every login to ([Single-Account Mode](#single-account-mode)). Empty = normal per-UUID accounts. |

Auth is optional — if `LUNAR_AUTH_URL` is unset the game server starts without it. `LUNAR_USER` is passed through from your shell or `.env` file, so `LUNAR_USER="PlayerName" docker compose up -d` runs the stack in single-account mode. The admin webhook is published to `127.0.0.1:8082` on the host so the master-data reload endpoint stays loopback-only by default; set `LUNAR_ADMIN_TOKEN` (e.g. via a `.env` file) before bringing the stack up.

## Claim Account

Transfers an existing game account to the most recently connected client. Looks up a player by their in-game name, assigns the new client's UUID to that account, and deletes the empty account the new client created.

Useful when a new client connects and creates a throwaway account, but you want it to load an existing account instead.

```bash
cd server
go run ./cmd/claim-account --name "PlayerName" --db db/game.db
```

| Flag     | Default      | Description                  |
| -------- | ------------ | ---------------------------- |
| `--name` | _(required)_ | In-game player name to claim |
| `--db`   | `db/game.db` | SQLite database path         |

## Auth Server

A separate HTTP server that handles player account registration and login. The patched client's Facebook login button is redirected to this server, which presents a username/password form. Tokens issued here are validated by the game server to link or recover accounts.

### Run

```bash
cd server
go run ./cmd/auth-server \
  --listen 0.0.0.0:3000 \
  --db db/auth.db
```

The `--secret` flag accepts a hex-encoded HMAC key. If omitted, a random key is generated on startup and printed to the console — pass it back on the next restart to keep existing tokens valid.

### Flags

| Flag            | Default        | Description                                                                |
| --------------- | -------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `--listen`      | `0.0.0.0:3000` | HTTP listen address (host:port)                                            |
| `--db`          | `db/auth.db`   | SQLite database path for auth users                                        |
| `--secret`      | _(generated)_  | Hex-encoded HMAC secret for token signing                                  |
| `--no-register` | `false`        | Disable new user registrations (only already registered users can log in). |

## Create account

This tool creates a fresh account in main db and new account in Auth Server store with given name & password and automatically binds them together.
A primary mean of registering new accounts when `--no-register` flag is passed to lunar-tear for controlled server access.

```bash
go run ./cmd/register-account --name "AccountName" --password "AccountPassword" --platform "android"
```

| Flag         | Default      | Description                                       |
| ------------ | ------------ | ------------------------------------------------- |
| `--name`     | _(required)_ | Auth Server account nickname to be registered     |
| `--password` | _(required)_ | Auth Server account password to be registered     |
| `--platform` | `android`    | Platform of new user account (`android` or `ios`) |
| `--db`       | `db/game.db` | SQLite main database path                         |
| `--auth-db`  | `db/auth.db` | SQLite Auth Server database path                  |

This only sets the nickname of Auth Server account, a player can choose their in-game nickname upon first login!
